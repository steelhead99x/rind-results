# [S] rind runs in OSS-Fuzz

## Goal

rind's `fuzz` crate targets run continuously in OSS-Fuzz, with crashes reported to the maintainer, and its coverage shows on OSS-Fuzz's dashboard.

## Plan

- Prepare the project files (`project.yaml`, `Dockerfile`, `build.sh`) and check them with OSS-Fuzz's `helper.py`, building every target with cargo-fuzz.
- Draft the google/oss-fuzz PR and its stated criticality, and show it to the maintainer before posting it.
- This was one of three children of an assurance epic (maintainer, 2026-11-07). On 2026-11-09 the maintainer chose ✅ ACVP to m2 and cryptofuzz deleted (rejected: retarget cryptofuzz at MozillaSecurity's fork, leave both in m4): ACVP is static vectors that need no outside approval, and cryptofuzz's upstream, guidovranken/cryptofuzz, is gone, with OSS-Fuzz's own cryptofuzz project disabled. Don't plan cryptofuzz again without a maintained upstream.
