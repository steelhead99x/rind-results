# [M] AES-GCM with internally generated IVs

## Goal

rind's FIPS module seals AES-GCM only with IVs it generates, as IG C.H
requires for approved encryption: random 96-bit IVs from the DRBG (scenario
2), and a TLS 1.3 IV unit that owns the record sequence counter and refuses
to wrap (scenario 5). Opening keeps taking the peer's nonce.

## Plan

From [the scope](/quest/m4/fips/README.md), 2026-11-11.

- Match aws-lc-rs's FIPS-motivated types, which MIGRATING.md maps to nothing
  today: `RandomizedNonceKey` over AES-GCM and `TlsRecordSealingKey`,
  `TlsRecordOpeningKey`, and `TlsProtocolId`. `rind`'s own
  `RandomizedNonceKey` stays XChaCha20-Poly1305, which is not approved.
- TLS 1.2's explicit-nonce scenario 1 waits for a consumer: rind-rustls's
  FIPS build needs only TLS 1.3, as SP 800-52r2 allows.
- ACVP's AES-GCM sets with `ivGen: internal` test both; random-IV sealing
  needs the [DRBG](/quest/m4/fips/drbg.md).

## Required

- [The DRBG](/quest/m4/fips/drbg.md) - the source of random IVs
