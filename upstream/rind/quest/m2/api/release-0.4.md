# [S] rind 0.4 ships once

## Goal

rind 0.4.0 on crates.io carries all three of the API epic's breaking changes: the typed AES-CBC IV, agreement keys that keep their public key, and no runtime CPU check. No release before it carries only some of them, and each adapter moves its `rind` requirement from 0.3 to 0.4 once, in a patch release from the same release PR.

## Plan

Decided with the maintainer on 2026-11-09:

- Releases: one rind 0.4 that carries all three breaking changes, and a MoQ-side PR ready before the adapter fixes publish ✅ (rejected: the 0.4 quest alone, accepting that MoQ's build breaks until fixed; leaving both to release-plz). Three breaking releases would re-pin every adapter three times, and each would leave a consumer that pins rind 0.3 with two copies of rind until it follows.
- Two of the three merged the same day, while rind's version was hand-set to 0.3.3 and unpublished: the typed CBC IV ([moq-dev/rind#530](https://github.com/moq-dev/rind/pull/530)) and the agreement keys ([moq-dev/rind#529](https://github.com/moq-dev/rind/pull/529)). A version set by hand ahead of the published one is kept as is (`CONTRIBUTING.md:146`), so release PR [moq-dev/rind#511](https://github.com/moq-dev/rind/pull/511) proposed publishing both as rind 0.3.3. On 2026-11-10 the maintainer chose ✅ to return rind's manifest to the published 0.3.2, so release-plz proposes 0.4.0 itself from the `!` commits, and hold the release for the last change (rejected: hand-set 0.4.0; set 0.4.0 and ship it now, with the CPU-check removal as 0.5; revert both and release 0.3.3). [moq-dev/rind#548](https://github.com/moq-dev/rind/pull/548) sets it; any later `!` change to rind then lands inside the same 0.4.0.
- So the adapter fixes of [Adapters offer exactly their upstream's API](/quest/m0/adapters/README.md) publish in the same release as rind 0.4, not before it, and MoQ's PR moves to both at once.

What remains is [rind needs no runtime CPU check](/quest/m2/api/cpu-check.md), which waits on that epic.

The hold uses only what the release tooling has. Publishing happens only when a release PR merges (`CONTRIBUTING.md:138`, `.release-plz.toml:6`), and one release PR covers every crate. So the hold is the maintainer leaving the release PR unmerged, and while it lasts no adapter fix and no pyrind release publishes either.

Before the release PR merges, check what it proposes:

- `rind` 0.4.0.
- Each adapter at its next patch version, requiring rind 0.4.0. A `!` commit or a removed item makes release-plz propose an adapter's next breaking version, which `sh/adapter-versions.sh` fails (`CONTRIBUTING.md:144`). [moq-dev/rind#548](https://github.com/moq-dev/rind/pull/548) set rind-rustls, rind-rcgen, rind-ring, and rind-str0m by hand for the changes merged by then; a later adapter PR with a `!` title sets its own patch version, as [moq-dev/rind#522](https://github.com/moq-dev/rind/pull/522) did.
- No breaking version for an adapter from the rind 0.4 requirement alone: its API did not change, so set its patch version by hand if release-plz proposes one.

Each change documents its own migration in MIGRATING.md, so this quest adds none. Delete it once 0.4.0 is published.

The benchmark report is refreshed once before each minor release (maintainer, 2026-11-09), so this quest requires that run. Whoever plans the next minor release's quest creates the next run at the same path, from the last one in git history, and requires it.

## Waiting

- Maintainer: leave the release PR, [moq-dev/rind#511](https://github.com/moq-dev/rind/pull/511) or whichever replaces it, unmerged until the CPU-check removal is on `main` and MoQ's PR is ready, then merge it. An agent cannot: a release PR merges on the maintainer's approval (`CONTRIBUTING.md:118`), and `.release-plz.toml` configures no way to hold one crate back, which is why the hold is the unmerged PR. Check: `cargo search rind` shows 0.4.0.

## Required

- [Benchmark report refresh, before rind 0.4](/quest/m2/bench/report-refresh.md) - the report and the README's claims, current for the release
- [rind needs no runtime CPU check](/quest/m2/api/cpu-check.md) - `cpu::check` and `MissingFeature` removed, the last of the three

## Related

- [Adapters offer exactly their upstream's API](/quest/m0/adapters/README.md) - its fixes publish in this release
